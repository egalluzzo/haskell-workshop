# Haskell Workshop

This is intended as a companion repository to the Pure Functional Programming
workshop.  Try the following approach of working through it.

1. Attend the presentation (if possible).
2. Starting with example 1, read the comments above each line,.  Then guess what you think that line will do before you execute it.  Finally, type it into `ghci` to see if you were correct.
3. Try your hand at the problems, starting with problem 1.
